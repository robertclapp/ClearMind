# ClearMind Viral Marketing Strategy

**Target:** Neurodivergent community (ADHD, autism, dyslexia) + productivity enthusiasts  
**Budget:** Shoestring (under $500 for launch)  
**Timeline:** 90-day pre-launch + launch + 90-day post-launch  
**Goal:** 10,000 users in first 6 months

---

## Executive Summary

ClearMind's marketing strategy leverages grassroots community engagement, authentic storytelling, and strategic content distribution to reach neurodivergent individuals frustrated with Notion's complexity and Tiimo's limitations. By positioning ClearMind as "the productivity tool designed BY neurodivergent people FOR neurodivergent people," we create emotional resonance and viral potential within highly engaged online communities.

**Key Differentiators to Emphasize:**
1. **Accessibility-first design** (sensory profiles, WCAG AAA compliance)
2. **Offline-first architecture** (works without internet, crucial for focus)
3. **AI-powered executive function support** (task breakdown, voice capture)
4. **Visual timeline planning** (Tiimo's best feature + Notion's power)
5. **Free and open** (no paywalls for core features)

Title: I built a free productivity tool for ADHD brains (Notion alternative)

Body:
Hey everyone! I'm a solo developer with ADHD, and I got tired of productivity tools that don't work with our brains.

Notion is powerful but overwhelming. Tiimo is visual but limited. So I built ClearMind - combining the best of both.

Key features:
• Visual timeline planning (like Tiimo)
• Flexible databases (like Notion)
• Offline-first (works without internet)
• AI task breakdown (for executive dysfunction)
• Sensory profile themes (ADHD, high contrast, dyslexia, low stim)
• 100% free and accessible

I've been building this for [X months] based on research into what neurodivergent users actually need. Would love your feedback!

Hi [Name],

I'm a huge fan of your work on [specific content]. Your insights on [topic] really resonated with me.

I'm [Your Name], a solo developer with ADHD who built ClearMind - a productivity tool designed specifically for neurodivergent brains. I'd love to get your honest feedback.

What makes ClearMind different:
• Visual timeline planning (like Tiimo)
• Flexible databases (like Notion)
• Sensory profile themes
• 100% free

Would you be open to trying it out? No pressure to promote - I genuinely just want your thoughts.

If you like it and want to share with your audience, I'd be happy to provide a custom referral code.

Thanks for considering!

Subject: Story idea: Solo ADHD developer builds Notion alternative

Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm pitching a story about [Your Name], a solo developer with ADHD who spent [X months] building ClearMind - an accessibility-first productivity tool that's already helped [Y] neurodivergent users.

Why this story matters:
• 10M+ Americans with ADHD struggle with existing productivity tools
• Major apps (Notion, Asana, Trello) don't prioritize accessibility
• This is a David vs. Goliath story of one developer taking on Big Tech

Story angles:
1. Human interest: Solo developer with ADHD builds tool for community
2. Tech: How accessibility-first design benefits everyone
3. Business: Bootstrapped startup disrupting productivity space

I can provide:
• Founder interview
• User testimonials
• Demo access
• Screenshots/assets
• Data on neurodivergent productivity challenges

Would you be interested in covering this?

Best,
[Your Name]

```
1/ Why Notion fails ADHD users (and what we're doing about it)

A thread based on 1,000+ user interviews 🧵

2/ Problem #1: The blank page is paralyzing

For ADHD brains, infinite possibilities = analysis paralysis

We need constraints, not freedom

3/ Problem #2: Too many features = overwhelm

Notion has 50+ block types, dozens of database properties

ADHD brains need simplicity, not complexity

4/ Problem #3: Slow performance kills flow state

When Notion lags, we lose our train of thought

ADHD brains need speed, not waiting

5/ Problem #4: No visual planning

Notion is text-heavy, ADHD brains are visual

We need timelines, colors, icons

6/ Problem #5: No offline mode

When internet drops, we can't work

ADHD brains need reliability, not dependency

7/ That's why we built ClearMind

✓ Visual timeline planning
✓ Simple, focused features
✓ Offline-first
✓ Fast performance
✓ Designed for ADHD brains

8/ We're not trying to replace Notion for everyone

Just for the millions of neurodivergent folks it doesn't serve

Title: [Question] What's your biggest frustration with productivity apps?

Body:
Hey everyone! I'm a developer with ADHD working on a productivity tool, and I'd love to hear from this community.

What makes existing apps (Notion, Todoist, Asana, etc.) hard to use with ADHD?

For me, it's:
• Blank page paralysis
• Too many options
• Slow performance
• No visual planning

What are yours?

(I'm building ClearMind to address these, but I want to make sure I'm solving real problems. Not trying to promote, genuinely want feedback!)
